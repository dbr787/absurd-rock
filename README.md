## To Do

- [] Improve copy/copied tooltip
- [] Maybe copy on hover over whole field
- [] When the copied button ends (3s) and the field is not hovered, the copy button should become invisible again
- [] Make boxes blue and pink, add handles to different corners for inner/outer rectangle, show h/w/r in different sides/corners
- [] add inner-columns and inner-rows, make it default 1x1, but allow 12x12
- [] create a tabbed code box for html/jsx/tailwind that allows to copy the code to generate that thing
- [] checkbox to lock/unlock inner radius from outer radius
- [] allow resizing of inner rectangle but snap to 1/12
- [] allow different radius for each corner (lock/unlock)
  .
- [] select grid size (i.e. 1px, 2px, 4px) this will control resize intervals
- [] hold shift to lock radius while resizing (show help)
- [] accordian drop-down for values or code block, tabs for code type (tailwind, jsx, tsx etc.)
- [] make cursor up and down also move the radius handle (currently only left and right)
- [] hide resize handles unless border is hovered
- [] make radius handle in front but slightly transparent
- [] make line dots 'move' like ants
- [] make radius handle smaller as box dimensions go smaller
- [] hide radius handle on resize handle grab
- [] hide resize handle on radius handle grab
- [] only show handles in that area when that corner or side is hovered
- [] make radius handle draggable towards any corner from the center
- [] make the area a grid or graph-like paper, then snap to the grid

## Original

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
